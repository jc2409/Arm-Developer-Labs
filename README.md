The state of the art of in software development is changing more rapidly than ever before.  Especially in fields like AI/ML, what was cutting-edge last year may have already been overtaken.  Arm Developer Labs is a repository of software and hardware project suggestions sourced from internal Arm teams and our network of eco-system partners but framed in way to be immediately accessible and useful to both academics and professional engineers alike. 

You can take a project as is, adapt it to your circumstances or simply take inspiration from it eg. for selecting a student project or PhD research topic.  Arm helps by providing contextual collateral and resources (including, where relevant, letters of support) and projects include meta-data tags to help you search and find the right one for you.

## What are the benefits?

You can be sure that any project you see here is valued by Arm or a named eco-system partner.  The scrolling list of logos shows which organizations have contributed suggestions.  Standout project contributions will result in preferential internal referrals to Arm Talent Acquisition (with digital badges for CV building).  And we are currently discussing with national agencies the potential for funding streams for Arm Developer Labs projects, which would flow to you, not us. 

## How does it work? 

To receive the benefits, you must show us your project through our [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/VZnJQLeRhD). Please do not include any confidential information in your contribution. Additionally if you are affiliated with an academic institution, please ensure you have the right to share your material.

Please note, we may contact you to discuss co-promotion opportunities. 

## What about mentorship/supervision? 

Most projects are designed to be self-serve with some attracting community support from Arm Ambassadors, who are part of our [Arm Developer program](https://www.arm.com/resources/developer-program?#register), and [SoC Labs](https://soclabs.org/) for those building FPGA implementations/ASICs. Projects tagged ‘Direct Arm Support’ go further to include some involvement from Arm engineers in a mentoring capacity.  Please note, Developer Labs is not an avenue to suggest full-scale collaboration with Arm or a means to secure funding from us. Instead, we are working behind the scenes with national bodies to try and attract funding flowing directly to university teams.


## Can I suggest a project? 

Yes!  If you’ve already been working on something that you believe is relevant – or just have a suggestion for a project or hackathon – then please tell us about it.  The only stipulation is that the submission must target Arm-based platforms.  We will review and contact you to follow up (meaning publish the project and/or support it in some way if it meets our threshold). 

Please get in touch via [our online form](https://forms.office.com/e/597pKN2JBW). Someone from Arm education will be in contact to discuss how we can support.
